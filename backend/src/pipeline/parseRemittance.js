// The input is a raw X12 835 document (a string), not JSON. That was
// confirmed against Stedi's real sandbox on 2026-09-08: their "835 ERAs"
// view hands back the actual EDI text, not a vendor-shaped JSON payload --
// which is better ground to build on than a guess would have been, since
// X12 835 is a fixed national standard (HIPAA 005010X221A1) rather than one
// company's schema that could change under us. The segment/element
// positions below are read directly off a real Stedi Test Payer remittance
// for a fully-paid claim; a real *denial* has never been seen (Stedi's test
// payer only ever pays in full or sends nothing at all -- see
// docs/mvp-v1-build-plan.html's sibling denial-loop notes), so the CAS
// (adjustment) and LQ (remark code) parsing below follows the published
// 835 spec rather than a confirmed real denied example. If a real denial
// payload ever turns up looking different, this is the one file to fix.
