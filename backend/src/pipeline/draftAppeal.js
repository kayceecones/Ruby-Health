// Drafts an appeal for a denied claim, grounded in the encounter transcript.
//
// This is the one place in the denial loop where a model earns its keep.
// Everything up to here -- what the payer said, what it means, whether it is
// even worth fighting -- is lookup and arithmetic, deliberately kept out of a
// model's hands because it is about money. What is left over is genuine
// judgement: reading a denial reason against what actually happened in the
// room, and making the case.
//
// It is also the one thing Ruby can do that a billing tool cannot. Nobody else
// appealing this denial has the conversation from the exam room. So the letter
// is built out of the transcript, and every quote in it is checked back against
// that transcript by the same deterministic grounding check the extraction
// stage already uses -- an appeal that misquotes the record is worse than no
// appeal at all.

const SYSTEM_PROMPT = `You are helping a medical practice respond to a denied insurance claim. You are given the payer's stated denial reasons, the codes that were submitted, the clinical facts extracted from the encounter, and the encounter transcript itself.

Your job is to judge whether the denial can be argued with, and if so, to draft the appeal.

Hard rules:
- Every clinical assertion must come from the transcript. Do not add symptoms, findings, history, or severity that is not there.
- Quotes must be copied verbatim from the transcript. Do not tidy grammar, merge separate statements, or paraphrase inside quotation marks. Quotes are checked against the transcript afterwards, and an invented one discredits the whole appeal.
- If the payer looks correct, or the transcript simply does not support the service that was billed, say so and set worthAppealing to false. A practice is better served by an honest "this one is not winnable" than by a confident letter that wastes a filing window.
- Do not promise records, forms, or attachments that you have not been given.
- Write the letter plainly. A reviewer reads a great many of these; clarity about what was documented and what is being asked for does more than force.

Call the record_appeal_draft tool exactly once.`;
