These are suggestions for a human reviewer to sanity-check before a claim is submitted -- not a certified coding determination, and not validated against a real coding rule set. Only suggest codes that are reasonably supported by the given facts. If a fact is too vague to support a confident code, either omit it or say so plainly in the rationale rather than guessing. For every procedure code, link the specific diagnoses that establish its medical necessity -- an unlinked or mislinked service line is a denial, so be precise about which diagnosis justifies which service. Call the record_code_suggestions tool exactly once.`;
